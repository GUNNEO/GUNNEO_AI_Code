            "Uneven thickening of the cervix, irregular soft tissue mass formation was seen, involving about 1/2 week of the cervix, the lesion was mainly located on the right side, with a larger dimension of about 2cm×1.6cm, the lesion showed a slightly high signal in T2W and isosignal in T1W, with significant enhancement in the early stage of enhancement, and reduced enhancement in the later stage, which was lower than that of the surrounding muscular layer. The lesion did not invade the uterus or vagina. The cervix and bladder, rectum fat gap is clear. The uterus was posteriorly positioned, the size and shape of the uterine body were normal, the signal was homogeneous, and no abnormal signal shadows were seen; the endometrium did not show obvious thickening. Several small follicles were seen in both ovaries, and no clear nodule or mass shadow was seen. Posterior to the left ovary, there was an oval-like, striated T2W high signal shadow, T1W was low signal, and no abnormal enhancement was seen. The bladder was well filled, no wall thickening was seen, and no abnormal signal shadow was seen in the lumen. The rectum and sigmoid colon showed no abnormality. No enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the pelvis or retroperitoneum. No effusion was seen in the pelvis."

            "The posterior lip of the cervix of the uterus increased in size and formed a soft tissue mass, about 28mm×26mm, which was isosignal on T1W, slightly high signal on T2W, and enhanced significantly, the lesion invaded the upper third of the vagina downward, and reached the level of the uterine narrows upward, the lesion did not break through the plasma layer, and the fat interstitial space between it and the rectum and the bladder was present. No definite enlarged lymph node shadow was seen in the pelvis. No clear signs of effusion were seen. The bone signals seen were normal."

            "The margin of the anterior lip of the cervix is slightly hairy, no clear nodule or mass shadow is seen at the cervix, no clear diffusion-restricted area is seen on DWI, and no abnormal foci of enhancement are seen on enhancement. Several long T1W and long T2W nodules were seen in the cervix, and no enhancement was seen on enhancement. The uterus was normal in size and morphology, with homogeneous signal and no abnormal signal shadow, no obvious thickening of the endometrium, long T1W and long T2W effusion shadows were seen in the uterine cavity, and the myometrium had a less homogeneous signal, and patches of T2W low-signal shadows were seen in it, with enhancement lower than that of the myometrium. Multiple small follicles were seen in bilateral ovaries, and no clear nodule or mass shadow was seen. The bladder was well filled, no wall thickening was seen, and no abnormal signal shadow was seen in the lumen. No abnormalities were seen in the rectum and sigmoid colon. No enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the pelvis or retroperitoneum. A small amount of fluid was present in the bilateral adnexal areas."

            "The mucosa of the cervical canal of the uterus was thickened, forming a soft tissue mass measuring about 3.8cm×3.4cm×3.1cm (anterior and posterior diameters×left and right diameters×upper and lower diameters), with clear borders, homogeneous signals, isosignal on T1WI, slightly high signal on T2WI, and mild enhancement after enhancement. The lesion was confined to the cervix, did not invade the body of the uterus upward, did not invade the vagina downward, and the anterior and posterior fornices were present; the lesion did not break through the plasma membrane layer of the cervix to involve the surrounding tissues and organs, and was clearly demarcated from the anterior wall of the rectum and the posterior wall of the bladder. An elliptical long T1 and long T2 signal shadow was seen anterior to the mid-vagina and posterior to the urethra, about 22.3mm×7.7mm, with no enhancement after enhancement and clear margins. The endometrium was about 10mm, no obvious thickening was seen, and no abnormal signal shadow was seen in the uterine cavity. Several small follicles were seen in both ovaries, and no clear nodule or mass shadow was seen. The bladder was well filled, no thickening of the wall was seen, and no abnormal signal shadow was seen in the lumen. No abnormalities were seen in the rectum and sigmoid colon. No enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the pelvis or retroperitoneum. No effusion was seen in the pelvis. No abnormalities were seen in the soft tissues of the pelvic wall and pelvic bones."
