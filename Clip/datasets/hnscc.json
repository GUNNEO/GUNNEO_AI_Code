Symmetrical patchy abnormal signal areas were seen around bilateral lateral ventricles, with equal or low signal in T1WI and high signal in T2WI and T2-FLAIR. The ventricular system was moderately dilated, and the sulcus and fissure were obviously widened, with obvious dilation of the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle, the right parietal lobe, and the sulcus of the temporal lobe. The midline structures were centered. The skull and sinuses were not abnormal.\nThe right portion of the tongue was swollen, and a mass of abnormal signal shadow was seen, about 44mm×44mm×25mm (anterior-posterior×up-and-down×right-left), with isosignal on the T1W, slightly high signal on the T2W, and limited diffusion on the DWI, with still clear margins, and obvious enhancement on enhancement scans; the septum of the tongue was partially affected, and the palatine tonsil on the right side was slightly larger than that on the contralateral side, and enhanced significantly on enhancement scans. Bilateral maxillary and mandibular alveolar bone scattered patchy long T1 and long T2 signal shadow, enhancement scan partially visible enhancement. The size and shape of nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx were not abnormal, and there was no obvious thickening of mucosa. There were multiple lymph nodes in areas I and II of the neck bilaterally and area III on the right side, with the largest one located in area I on the left side, about 15.5 mm × 10 mm. The morphology and signal of parotid gland and submandibular gland bilaterally did not show any abnormality.\nCE-MRA: the walls of bilateral common carotid arteries, internal and external carotid arteries, and vertebral arteries were not smooth, and the beginning segment of right vertebral artery was unevenly narrowed, but the remaining carotid arteries did not have any limited stenosis or dilatation; the walls of bilateral common carotid arteries at the bifurcation and right vertebral arteries were thickened, and a patchy T2WI high-signal shadow was seen."

            "The left side of the tongue body and the root of the tongue increased in size, and a mass-like abnormal signal shadow was seen, measuring about 30.9mm × 23.7mm × 29.1mm, with isosignal on T1W and slightly high signal on T2W, and the margins were unclear, and the septum of the tongue was invaded, with the disappearance of the V-shaped boundary groove, the disappearance of paraglossal hiatus, and the mass crossed the midline and invaded the right tongue, and the muscles of the left floor of the mouth were slightly compressed, and the left soft palate and tonsils were also invaded. After enhancement, the above lesions showed mild-moderate enhancement and narrowing of the oropharyngeal cavity. The size and shape of the nasopharyngeal cavity were not abnormal, and the mucosa was not significantly thickened. Two enlarged lymph nodes were seen under the chin, with sizes of about 16.0mm×8.0mm and 15.8mm×8.4mm respectively, and the bilateral parotid and submandibular glands were small in size, with no abnormal signals or foci of enhancement, and the left and right lobes of the thyroid gland were enlarged in size, with non-uniform signals, and multiple nodular shadows were seen in the left and right lobes of the thyroid gland, which were equal to or with slightly low signals on T1WI, and with high signals on T2WI, with the larger one located in the left lobe of the thyroid, about 25% of which was in the left lobe of the thyroid. The larger one was located in the left lobe of the thyroid gland, which was about 25.5mm×16.0mm, and the enhancement scan showed mild and moderate enhancement."

            "Right base of mouth-right mandibular mass, about 63mm×43mm, iso-signal on T1W, slightly high signal on T2W, small patchy long T1 long T2 signal shadow in the center, inhomogeneous and obvious enhancement of the lesion after enhancement, and no enhancement of the patchy shadow in the center. The lesion encroached forward into the right mandible, alveolar bone and its inner and outer peripheral gingiva, and a cortical soft tissue mass was formed, which shifted upward with the right base of the tongue, the right tongue margin, and the tongue midline to the left, and caused the right tongue body to be mildly elevated, and the lesion was indistinctly demarcated from the right root of the tongue, and from the right floor of the mouth muscles, while the left root of the tongue and the muscles of the floor of the mouth did not have any abnormal signal shadows. The scanned nasopharyngeal cavity did not show abnormal size and morphology, and the mucosa did not show obvious thickening. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the right submandibular and lateral neck deep vascular sheath area, about 15mm×14mm, with moderate enhancement after enhancement."

The size and morphology of the nasopharyngeal cavity were not abnormal, and there was no obvious thickening of the mucosa. The morphology and signal of bilateral sublingual gland, submandibular gland and bilateral parotid gland were not abnormal. The morphology, size, and signal of the epiglottis, bilateral vocal cords, and ventricular cords did not show any abnormality; the surfaces were smooth, no abnormal signal shadow was seen, and no abnormal enhancement foci were seen after enhancement. There was no thickening of the anterior union of the vocal folds, and the bilateral paravalvular spaces were clear. The bilateral pyriform fossa was symmetrical, and the aryepiglottic folds did not show obvious thickening. Enlarged lymph nodes were seen in the bilateral cervical regions 1 and 2, and the right cervical region 3, the larger of which was located in the right cervical region 3, with a diameter of about 10mm×6mm, and enhancement was seen."
